  This program takes two inputs:
  1. the insert file with two fields, first being the sequence and second being the number of times this seuqence been read;
  2. a standard BED file produced by bowtie reading the 1st file as input.
  and produces BED2 format, with 1-3 fields being name of chromosome, start and end, same as standard BED format.
  But the 4th column is the number of times this sequence been read, 5th column being the number of times this sequence being
  mapped. the 6th column is the sequence itself.
  usage:
  istBed2Bed2  input.insert  mapped.bed  >  output.bed2
  Please contact piPipesQ@gmail.com for any questions or bugs.
